<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>SOURDOUGH STARTER: </li>
    <li>FLOUR:</li>
    <li>WATER: (Hydration)  385 grams</li>
    <li>BAKING:  500F</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>10 am-12 noon: Feed the sourdough starter.  8-12 hours before you plan to mix up the dough, feed your starter. (Or feel free to use an unfed starter for a more “sour taste”, straight from the fridge at 8 pm)</li>
    <li>8 pm:  Mix. Mix the dough. Cover for 15 more mins, stretch and fold. Repeat one more time.</li>
    <li>8:30 pm: Proof.  Cover, let proof (rise) overnight,8-12 hours at 65-70F on the kitchen counter.</li>
    <li> 6-8 am:  Shape. Check your dough when you awake, and when it has almost doubled in size, stretch, fold, and shape. Place in a parchment-lined bowl seam side down. Place this in the fridge for 1 hour while you preheat the oven (heating up your dutch oven or bread baker too, for 50-60  minutes at 475-500F) </li>
    <li>8-9 am:  Place & Score. Pull your heated dutch oven out of the oven. Lift your shaped dough, lifting out by the parchment, carefully place into the hot dutch oven. Score the bread using a sharp knife  (lightly oiled) or razor blade or bread lame, cutting a single slash, a crescent-shaped slit into the dough at a 30-45 degree angle, one inch deep, or smaller tiny cuts.</li>
    <li>9:00 am  Bake with the lid on for 20-25 minutes. Remove lid, lower heat to 45oF and bake 15 more minutes, until very deeply golden, and internal temp reaches 208F. You will want it darker than you might think. Let it cool on a rack before cutting. If you like a softer crust bake covered 25 minutes, uncovered 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>9:45  Cool and enjoy!</li>
